# Subseasonal Data Python Package

The `subseasonal_data` package provides an API for loading and manipulating the **SubseasonalClimateUSA** dataset developed for training and benchmarking subseasonal forecasting models.  Here, _subseasonal_ refers to climate and weather forecasts made 2-6 weeks in advance.  See [DATA.md](https://github.com/microsoft/subseasonal_data/blob/main/DATA.md) for a description of dataset contents, sources, and processing.

## Getting Started

- Install the subseasonal data package: `pip install subseasonal-data`
- Define the environment variable `$SUBSEASONALDATA_PATH` to point to your desired data directory; any accessed data files will be read from, saved to, or synced with this directory

 This package is compatible with Python version 3.6+. 
 
 The underlying data is made available through Azure and is updated periodically. To download the data through this package, you will need to have the Azure Storage CLI [`azcopy`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy) installed on your machine.

## Usage Examples

Detailed usage examples are provided in the `Getting Started` and `Examples` notebooks in the `examples` folder. It is recommended you start there.

Quick examples:

* Download all data

**WARNING:** This requires an estimated 175GB disk space.

```Python
from subseasonal_data import downloader

downloader.download()
```

* List files in a data directory

```Python
downloader.list_subdir_files(data_subdir="combined_dataframes")
```

* Download one data file

```Python
downloader.download_file(
    data_subdir="combined_dataframes", 
    filename="all_data-us_precip_34w.feather", 
    verbose=True)
```

* Load ground truth data

```Python
from subseasonal_data import data_loaders

# Loads into a Pandas dataframe
df = data_loaders.get_ground_truth("us_precip")
```

* Load combined dataframes

```Python
data_loaders.load_combined_data("all_data", "us_tmp2m", "34w")
```

See the [Examples.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/subseasonal_data/blob/main/examples/Examples.ipynb) notebook for an example on how to retrieve historical temperature data using the `subseasonal_data` package.

## For Developers

### Installation

Install from source in editable mode using `pip install -e .` in this directory or `pip install -e path/to/directory` from another directory. 

### Running tests 

To test your installation, run `python -m unittest [test_name].py` from the `subseasonal_data/tests` directory or `python -m unittest path/to/tests/folder/[test_name].py`. Example:

```Python
python -m unittest subseasonal_data/tests/test_data_loaders.py
```

### Generating Documentation

This project's documentation is generated via [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html). The HTML theme used is the [Read the Docs](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) sphinx theme which also needs to be installed.

To generate a local copy of the documentation from a clone of this repository, run `python setup.py build_sphinx -W -E -a`, which will build the documentation and place it under the `build/sphinx/html` path. 

The reStructuredText files that make up the documentation are stored in the `docs` directory; module documentation is automatically generated by the Sphinx build process.
